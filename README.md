# MatlabAcousticAnalysis
Matlab software for analysis of underwater sound from .wav files and production of metrics.
The files in this reposity are intended for the anlysis of underwater
acoustic recordings in .wav files. It will generate the following nine 
differente metrics: SPL, Leq, Lpeak, L1, L5, L10, L50, L90 and L95 for 
the following signals: original, broadband (filtered from 20 Hz to 20 
KHz) and one-third-octave band signals from 20 Hz to 20 Khz (31 signals).
The results will be saved in .hd5 format, one .hdf5 file per .wav file.
